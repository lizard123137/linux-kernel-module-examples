# linux-kernel-module-examples

This project is a collection of examples related to linux kernel module development.

I am using it to expand my knowledge on kernel development. A lot of it is based on a youtube series by a guy called **Johannes 4GNU_Linux**.

The examples have comments explaining various aspects of kernel development.
